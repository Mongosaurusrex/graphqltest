# graphqltest

This is a testing project for my own sake where I build a job board graphQL-powered site.

## To run the project:
**In /client**
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
this will open a new browserpage with the job board site

**In /server**
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
this will start a node server hosting the GraphQL "api" and additional express based auth endpoints
